			"content": "Join us on Saturday, June 2 for the fourth annual Eaglesham Beer Festival.  The festival kicks off at 11am for VIP ticket holders, 12 noon for everyone else, and will run until 7pm - and it's going to be huge.  Despite having over 3500 revellers through our gates last year, there were still hundreds who were left disappointed because they hadn't bought tickets in advance.<br /><br />Being queued out the door for much of the day showed us just how much you want to be part of the special day, so this year we are selling more tickets to stop you, our loyal patrons, being turned away at the gates - but make sure and be quick, because once they are gone, they are gone.<br /><br />As usual, we'll have some of the finest beers and brewers Scotland has to offer, with fine wines, prosecco and some of the finest street food vendors and fayre around. On top of that we'll have a brand new, innovative gin created and bottled with one of Scotland's most sought after botanists. And not only will there be plenty to keep the tastebuds and belly happy, there will be foot-stomping, hand-raising, head-bopping music from a number of top quality musicians. There might even be something for our four-legged friends.<br /><br />As usual, you'll have to stay tuned here on our website, on our social media channels, and traditional media for up-to-date information about what's sure to be our biggest and best festival yet."

			"content": "Getting to the beer festival couldn't be easier. While it doesn't have its own train station, the village is well served by Clarkston station and regular bus services from the city centre. We've made some suggestions below.<h4 style='font-weight:bold'>By Bus</h4>Catch the 4A service on Union Street in Glasgow city centre. It runs roughly half hourly on a Saturday and will drop you right outside the festival site in 40 minutes. If you're coming from East Kilbride there's an hourly 395 service run by McGill's that leaves from the train station. If you're travelling from the Barrhead area you can catch that service on its way back from Uplawmoor.<h4 style='font-weight:bold'>By Train</h4>Clarkston train station is only 25 minutes from Glasgow Central and the service departs at 18 and 48 mins past the hour on a Saturday. On arrival you can get a taxi costing around £6 from either East Ren Taxis (0141 644 0404) or Eastwood Mearns (0141 638 7041). Alternatively you can head out to Busby Rd and catch the 4A bus on its way up to Eaglesham.<h4 style='font-weight:bold'>By Car</h4>While we'd love everyone to leave the car at home and enjoy some fantastic beer, we realise it's not possible for everyone. There's no dedicated parking at the beer festival so you'll have to find a parking space on the street. We ask that you're mindful of local residents and park your cars considerately."

We have teamed up with leading pet store, The Pet Empawrium, to create a dedicated area to dog lovers. And we think this is the first pub of its kind in Scotland. <br /><br />Together, the EagBeerFest team and The Pet Empawrium will actively ensure there is a pint, wine, nibbles and somewhere to sit and play for dogs at this year's event. There'll be plenty of dog beer and Pawsecco, tasty treats, chew toys on offer, with Dug's Pub well kitted-out to make sure your dog enjoys the festival.<br /><br />Dug's Pub will be a great place for canine lovers to mingle, relax and have a beer or two of their own - and that's human beer. There may even be a dog-themed whisky to check out. Not only will they be serving up top doggy tipples, but the Pet Empawrium will be offering up an impressive range of their natural treats and foods. And on the day they will be joined by their fantastic veterinary team, Champion Vets, to offer a number of dog treatments, including grooming, free check-ups and training advice."

Shi contains the souls of many hop vines, help them escape to a new life! \n\nA rich nose with wheaty, yeasty and hoppy characters mingling with full-on mango and passion fruit. Added to that comes a kick of honeycomb, banana and a touch of sourness. The palate is sweet, very soft and delicate with an apple and tropical fruit 'bite' with a superbly balanced bitterness. \n\nThis belter of a Belgian Double IPA simply 'raises' the bar in its style.",

					"brewery_description": "OPENED in June 1st 2016, our brewery is based in South Queensferry; the first and only brewery in The Ferry since 1851. We have started with humble beginnings and hope to develop a great reputation for good tasting quality beer that grows beyond the shores of South Queensferry.\n\nQueensferry is known for its wealth of history – from the Forth Bridge, Forth Road Bridge and the new Queensferry Crossing Bridge – so we wanted to contribute to the historic attraction by creating a revival of local brewing in The Ferry after 165 years. Our goal is to encapsulate the history of the Ferry in our brewery as evidenced in our logo and the names of our beers. Our beers will combine traditional and historic beer recipes with a contemporary twist.\n\nAdditionally, we expect that the Brewery will provide an additional point of interest – place to go and something to do - for residents, visitors and tourists alike where they can explore the history of brewing in The Ferry, witness the handcrafting of beer and enjoy a good pint. Once the Brewery is opened to the public, customers will be able to take a brewery tour during the allotted times. Coming soon will be our Tap Bar where customers will be able to sample various beers – pale ales, bitters, reds, porters, 80/-s, stouts - before buying bottles, mini casks and beer-to-go varieties. We will also craft seasonal as well as Brewer specialities from time to time. In addition to handcrafted beers, customers will be able to purchase a wee brewery gift item as a token of their visit.\n\nWith over 25 years of home brewing, 4+ years of planning, brew school, over a year and a half of crafting beers for tasters and months of sweat & tears to finance, design, renovate, construct our premises, we are happy to have started production of our handcrafted beers.",

So undo the top button of your pressed pits overalls, ease into the wingback and roll out a rare taste of a truly great British beer.\n\nOld Engine Oil is a remarkably smooth, creamy brew with a beautiful velvety mouthfeel. Enjoy flavours of coffee, slightly buttered toffee, dark chocolate and earthy hops. You may find some mild cherry fruit within the residual sweetness, neatly accompanying the roasted flavours that ride with you all the way to the finish.\n\nBorn in 2000, this winner of the first ever Tesco Beer Challenge was always designed to have a thick, dark, gloopy appearance. We piled in the oats to smooth out the bitterness from the roast barley and laid on a super-high-temperature mash to make the wort less fermentable. The result is a really black beer that has a greater sweetness and fuller flavour than many other stouts and porters, as well as a surprisingly light texture.\n\nHOPS: Galena, East Kent Goldings, Fuggles\n\nMALTS: Roast barley, oats",

								"beer_description": "Note: This beer is 8% ABV in bottle, 10.5% in cask and keg.\n\nOla Dubh (pronounced ‘ola-doo’ and Gaelic for ‘black oil’) was conceived in 2007. It was the first ale to be matured in whisky barrels from a named distillery and, with traceable casks and numbered bottles, it is a beer with real provenance. To make Ola Dubh 12, we take our Old Engine Oil (amped up to 10.5%) and age it for up to 6 months in casks that previously held Highland Park 12 Year Old single malt. And it is ready only when our head brewer, Stuart, deems it ready!\n\nThis amazing brew has been aged in selected oak casks formerly used to mature Highland Park 12 Year Old Single Malt Whisky, adding complementary whisky notes to our chocolatey, bittersweet beer.\n\nOla Dubh 12 pours black with a modest spattered head that reduces slowly, leaving behind textbook lacing. The aroma is delicious; smoky Worcestershire sauce, leather, iodine and grilled steak. Flavours of smoky-sweet malts, roasted peat, coffee beans and a well-bittered finish. Overall this is a rather exotic brew with a defined barrel influence. It’s refined rather than over the top and very delicious indeed.\n\nHOPS: Galena, East Kent Goldings, Fuggles\n\nMALTS: Roast barley, oats",

It was the first ale to be matured in whisky barrels from a named distillery and, with traceable casks and numbered bottles, it is a beer with real provenance.

And it is ready only when our head brewer, Stuart, deems it ready!\n\nThe initial whisky hit on the nose gives way to more delicate aromas of chocolate, fruity coffee grounds and hints of woodland berries. The flavour is a very appetising blend of sweet malts, vanilla, oak and tobacco. It has undertones of raisins and other dark, dried fruits; a delicious testament to Highland Park’s bias toward sherry casks.\n\nHOPS: Galena, East Kent Goldings, Fuggles",

In contrast to the punchy, dark Ola Dubhs aged in casks from the wild isles of Orkney, Orach Slie is a much lighter, easy-going beer that reflects the softer, sweeter malts of Glenfarclas which nestles in the rolling Speyside moors of Banffshire. Having trialled a variety of different beers, the brewers settled on a lightly-hopped, high-abv version of Schiehallion to perfectly complement the classic, honeyed-sherry malts of Glenfarclas. \nOrach Slie pours a light straw colour and immediately displays a delicate malty character on the nose.

So undo the top button of your pressed pits overalls, ease into the wingback and roll out a rare taste of a truly great British beer.\n\nOld Engine Oil is a remarkably smooth, creamy brew with a beautiful velvety mouthfeel. Enjoy flavours of coffee, slightly buttered toffee, dark chocolate and earthy hops. You may find some mild cherry fruit within the residual sweetness, neatly accompanying the roasted flavours that ride with you all the way to the finish.\n\nBorn in 2000, this winner of the first ever Tesco Beer Challenge was always designed to have a thick, dark, gloopy appearance. We piled in the oats to smooth out the bitterness from the roast barley and laid on a super-high-temperature mash to make the wort less fermentable. The result is a really black beer that has a greater sweetness and fuller flavour than many other stouts and porters, as well as a surprisingly light texture.\n\nHOPS: Galena, East Kent Goldings, Fuggles\n\nMALTS: Roast barley, oats",

								"beer_description": "Time for a proper fiesta!\n\nAfter brewing Mango Berlinner, we thought to make something that was its complete opposite. Something dark, rich, and packed with big, bold flavours. The discussions led us to a \"Mexican Cake\" concept, brewing an imperial stout and adding cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa, and chillies. And what a beer it turned out to be!\n\nThe aroma is mouthwatering, with hints of the vanilla and cocoa used in the brew and a soft cinnamon to prepare you for the taste. One sip and you'll get that smooth, velvety texture that perfectly complements the slight roast flavour from the malt and deep chocolate notes. Two sips, and your mouth will be enveloped in the complex spice notes from the cinnamon and chillies; we used Mulato and Chipotle chillies for a slight fruitiness and to add depth to the spice. In the finish of the first few sips, you'll notice a very low warmth from the chillies and the last mingling hints of the cinnamon and vanilla making you want even more.\n\nIt pairs beautifully with puddings, and for a summer time twist it works surprisingly well as an ice cream float.\n\nGrab a bottle, laze out in the sun, and enjoy our Mexican inspired dessert in a bottle.",

On the palate, big mouthfeel, citrus, and resin, with a bit of alcohol warmth in the finish. \n\nThe Vermont yeast delivers body and a unique fruits ester profile with hints of apricot. Also not very floculent so a bit of a characteristic haze but not too much. Good to have a little yeast in suspension though as it helps carry the flavour.\n",

It's something a lot of people asked about, and something that to us made a lot of sense. However, we've aged in not one but two different barrel types; Bourbon, and Brandy.\r\n\r\nBourbon Barrel bring exactly what you'd expect; a little bit of whiskey on the nose and warmth on the finish, and enhances some of the best flavours in Mexicake. On the nose, you get an intense vanilla aroma, the slight spiciness of bourbon highlights the Ceylon cinnamon, and a touch of toasted oak. On the palate, you get much of the same with a super smooth mouthfeel, and a bit of boozy warmth. Pay close attention, and you'll also get a bit of char and smokiness from the barrel aided by the infusion of Mulato chillies famous for their leathery, tobacco smokiness. \r\n\r\nA beautifully decadent beer, it's in very short supply and will not last long.",

Everyone at the brewery has had a chilli IPA at some time or another, so we came together and thought about what we liked and didn't like and what we could brew that would be our perfect version of that type of beer. We used a LOT of jalapenos in the brew, and added lime juice to complement the fruitier flavours of the pepper, as well as a generous dry hopping with Motueka. \n\nOn first sip it's refreshing with a good balanced bitterness like any of our IPAs, with a tang of lime and hint of tropical, citrus notes from the dry hopping. At first, you'll reckon it has quite a subtle little spiciness to it in the finish, however the more you drink the more that heat builds and you get a really powerful but pleasant jalapeno kick. It somehow manages to be cold and refreshing, and hot and spicy all at once.\n\nWe're planning on making this be part of our \"Holy Trinity\" of chilli inspired beers...so watch out for the third!\n",

Ancho Dark Lager is a 5.1% cold fermented lager made with a blend of dark malt, showcasing the mild and flavourful Ancho chilli pepper. \n\nTo recap, we used the IPA style to showcase jalapeno in Dios Mio, Imperial Stout for Chipotle and Mulato in Mexicake, and now a dark lager for Ancho chillies. We wanted to do three totally different styles of beer, and we wanted to put a twist on those styles at the same time, so Ancho Dark Lager is the perfect example of this approach.\n\nGavin sums it up pretty well in terms of what's so great about this particular dark lager: \" I like the lager fermentation which gives it the clean drinkability but the chocolate , subtle spice and ancho chilli flavour makes it interesting\"\n\nBe sure to check out Mexicake and Dios Mio; the other beers in the Holy Trinity!\n",

For our latest barrel aged concoction, we decided to pay homage to one of the original, classy cocktails that would truly test our ability to balance flavours. What's more, it's in 660ml bottles and hand labelled and wax dipped for that extra touch.\r\n\r\nThe Old Fashioned takes our well-loved orange and ginger double IPA, and infuses it with the smooth, warming, vanilla character of Heaven Hill’s famous Kentucky straight bourbon. Sweet and rich on the nose, you’ll likely be surprised at just how reminiscent of its namesake it is. The vanilla and oak from the barrel brings out the sweeter notes in the orange and ginger on the palate, but the hops give that distinct bitterness you’d expect in the cocktail itself and a lasting warmth in the finish. It has also been conditioned in bottle, allowing it to develop a rich, smooth texture that goes down a treat.\r\n\r\nThis has a pale ale base with lots of hops and citrus fruits; you want to taste the freshness. It is not for extended maturation. Despite its bottle conditioning, it will not benefit from extended aging, as we have matured it in barrels already.",

But what do you do with 'little snoop' during the summer festival season, in crowded fields with loud music and thousands of people?  Well, the Eaglesham Beer Festival has you covered.<br /><br />We absolutely love dogs and felt it was about time to take the next step and make sure our four-legged friends were catered for So, introducing Dug's Pub, we have teamed up with The Pet Empawrium in East Kilbride to serve up plenty of dog beer and Pawsecco, tasty treats, chew toys and an area dedicated to dogs and dog lovers. As well as being kitted out with everything dogs need to enjoy a festival, Dug's Pub will be a great place for canine lovers to mingle, relax and have a beer or two of their own - and that's human beer.<br /><br />The Pet Empawrium on Glenburn Road in East Kilbride is Scotland's first all-inclusive pet centre, stocking an extensive range of natural treats and foods for animals, including a wide range of raw food and treats, quality apparel and toys. So you might say Dug's Pub is the perfect day out for dog lovers this summer."
